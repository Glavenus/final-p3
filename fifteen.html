    <p id="center">American puzzle author and mathematician Sam Loyd is often falsely credited with creating the puzzle; indeed, 
        Loyd claimed from 1891 until his death in 1911 that he invented it. The puzzle was actually created around 1874 by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York.
